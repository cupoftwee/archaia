    <h2>About the Server</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>Archaia: the Old Woods is a queer-friendly, casual Valheim server. We're mostly casual players who know each other IRL and like having a space place to relax together. We are probably slower at progression than anybody else, so if you're looking to powergame, you may want to find another server.</p>
    
    <p>We are notable in that we are aggressively strict about bigotry, bad behavior, griefing, etc - it is not at all tolerated. The Old Woods does not abide BS.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in joining the server, please fill out the below form to apply.</p>

    <h2>About this Site</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>There may be a question as to why this site exists, if we are such a small server of infrequent, casual players. The answer lies within Valheim's server UI, which as of 2021, does not remember which servers you have connected to previously. Every time one connects, one must enter the server's IP, port, and password, which is quite inconvenient. Adding to our grief, most message services add an `http://` to the links, which renders them useless when pasted.</p>

    <p>The compromise we found was to have an easy-to-access copy of the server info on hand and that meant some plain ol' vanilla HTML, CSS, & JS. This site is made using the excellent <a href="https://watercss.kognise.dev/" target="_blank">Water.css</a>, is hosted using <a href="" target="_blank">Netlify</a>, and has its code publicly available on <a href="" target="_blank">Gitlab</a>.</p>
