> A queer-friendly Valheim server

### Overview
Hey there! You've found the readme for the website for the Valheim server whose lengthy fantasy name surely has convinced you of our dedication to video gaming immersion.

Are you looking for a Valheim server where everybody plays very slowly and mostly enjoys the meadows as a walking and hunting sim? Where bigotry is not welcome or tolerated, and you trust your neighbors? Join us today, or don't!

### Server Info
Server IP: `147.135.104.178:4350`
PW: Available upon request
Population: 5/10 (as of 21.08.03)

### About this Site
Due to Valheim's (currently) less-than-ideal interface for joining servers, copying and pasting the server info and password is a regular need every time one decides to log on. So, I wanted to make something quick and fun that recreated Valheim's style in web technologies and also let us join our server easier.

### Running Locally
